          <p>
            <span456>S</span456>amathy Woo used to buy clothes almost every week when working at an investment bank.

            Ten years ago, she and her two friends organized a semi-public swap party where people could exchange things
            they no longer needed. The party turned out to be a great success. Later they started the online swap
            platform, <a href="https://www.jupyeah.com/">Jupyeah</a>, meaning “making stuff” in Cantonese.
          <div class="imgside">

            </p>

          </div>They also
          hold offline swapping events from time to
          time. Participants may bring the things they no longer need to the event and take preloved things from other
          people freely.
          </p><br>

          <p>As the CFO and one of the event coordinators at Jupyeah, Samathy witnesses how many clothes Hong Kong
            people
            have dumped over the years.
          </p><br>


          <p>
            She remembers there was one time they finished the Jupyeah event and returned to the warehouse. She saw many
            clothes
            and shoes there. “When the event ended, there were more than 20 bags of stuff left. The biggest IKEA bag,
            you
            know, has more than 20 bags. (Only) clothes.” Samathy recalled, “When I saw those clothes, I was so
            depressed.” “Why are there so many clothes? I was so annoyed.” When she went back home, she started to clean
            the closet.
          </p><br>

          <p>
            In the beginning, her closet was “too stuffed to put another piece of clothes in there.” It took her two
            days to clean the wardrobe. During the cleaning process, she found that some of the clothes she had never
            tried and others did not fit anymore. “There are only several clothes I like to wear. Then I always think I
            don’t have enough clothes and then go shopping. Then
            not wearing (those clothes),” said Samathy.
          </p><br>

          <p>
            She then took the clothes she no longer needed to the next Jupyeah event for other people to choose from.
            Now she only keeps the necessary clothes in the closet. Sometimes, she would also pick items from the event.
            “The dress I am wearing today is from one of Jupyeah’s events,” said Samathy.

          <h2 class="mt-0  mb-3 font-weight-normal" style="text-align: left;"> Overconsumption of clothes in Hong Kong
          </h2><br>
          <p>Data shows that Hong Kong people buy more clothes than they need.

            As the <a

            from Redress in 2020 reports, two in five people in Hong Kong hold their clothes no longer than a year.
            Nearly one-third of the clothes in Hong Kong people’s closets
            are never or rarely worn. The rate almost doubled from 16% as suggested in a research from <a
              href="https://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/press/1892/greenpeace-releases-hong-kong-and-taiwan-consumer-report/">Greenpeace</a>
            in 2016.

          <p>Ms. Fok just graduated from university. She has 15 to 20 sets of clothes that she wears frequently. “For
            the whole wardrobe, I think there are more than 30 sets of clothes. But for some of them, I do not think of
            wearing it.” She said.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Ellie Zhuang came to Hong Kong around seven years ago. She admits that many of her clothes are left in her
            wardrobe. “Probably just put it there and not take it out nor wear it for two years.” She said.
          </p><br>
          Wrong style, impulse purchase, and forgetting of having the clothes are the three most common reasons people
          leave their clothes unused, according to the Redress report.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>“Our study shows that in Hong Kong, people's clothing behaviors are not at all aligned with the United
            Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. With fashion's
            environmental impact set to drastically worsen, our results prove that Hong Kong has a long way to go
            towards steering a more sustainable fashion industry,” said <a

          </h2>
          <br>

          <p>According to Redress, 61% of Hong Kongers give away their unwanted clothes to organizations that can
            recycle them, and 30% of respondents throw away their clothes into the bins.

          However, not every piece of clothes can be recycled or reused. “Clothes that only use one material or can
          easily be taken apart can be recycled,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00NIQgQE_d4&t=285s">said
            Maxi Bohn</a>, a senior
          product development expert who has over ten years of experience in the retail industry.</p><br>
          <p>
            According to <a href="https://www.redress.com.hk/takeback">Redress</a>, if the clothes are moldy, possibly
            contaminated with other items, in poor condition
            (e.g., broken), or the material is not recyclable, they would send it to the landfill. Around 1-3% of items
            they received, including actual rubbish such as masks, tissues, food wrappers, etc., end up in landfills.
          </p><br>

            According to the <a

              Department (EPD)</a> in Hong Kong, more than 95 thousand tonnes of
            textile waste is generated in Hong Kong every year. Only 7.6 percent of them are recycled. This is
            lower than <a
              href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/textiles-material-specific-data#TextilesTableandGraph">the
              rate in the US</a> three years ago. Around 242 tonnes of textile waste end up in landfills every
            day. That is the weight of 2.5 million t-shirts.</p> <br>

            <p><a href="https://gl.sjs.org.hk/">Green Ladies & Green Little</a>, one of the most well-known social eco
              enterprises in Hong Kong, is the first locel eco
              enterprise
              that adopts the consignment model for the secondhand clothes business. Consignors may take
              their unwanted clothes to Green Ladies’ shop. Before giving the clothes to the Green
              Ladies, consignors should clean the clothes. The staff will then check if the clothes meet the
              requirements
              (style, quality, and condition). If so, Green Ladies will display the clothes in the store for up to two
              months. If no one buys it after two months, Green Ladies will use the clothes for other purposes.
            </p><br>
            <p>“For example, we collaborate with <a href="https://www.themills.com.hk/">The
                Mills</a>. They got some art exhibitions occasionally. So sometimes
              they
              will ask us to reserve some of the clothing to help them to create the artwork piece (s).” said Petty Lee,
              the
              project manager of Green Ladies & Green Little St. James' Settlement.

            <p>They would also donate unsold clothes to some international schools for teaching activities. “They just
              send
              us an email and telling us that they would like to have some clothing for their new syllabus and
              to
              let those students use it as the materials to like upcycle the clothing and redesign the clothing for the
              sustainable week,” She said.

            <p>Jupyeah also collaborates with The Mills for small events. Also, at the end of August, Jupyeah held its
              first offline event in 2021 in collaboration with Hysan Place. Hysan Place offered to fund that event. “At
              the beginning, no one finds us (for collaboration). Because no one knew us,” Samathy recalled, “I think it
              was after two to three years, the government found us for cooperation.” After then, Jupyeah began to
              receive invitations from private companies to organize workshops for the companies from time to time.
              “Social media is very important. If you are famous, many companies will come to you.” She said.</p> <br>

            <p>However, she also suggested that it is not efficient to recycle the massive amount of secondhand clothes
              by holding offline swap events periodically. “The impact is not very big.” She said. Since it takes a lot
              of time and energy to organize an event, it is also impossible to regularly hold offline events. Jupyeah
              now also runs its clothes recycling business. People may pay Jupyeah to pick up the clothes they no longer
              need. Jupyeah would then take pictures of the clothes and put them on their website for people to choose
              from.</p><br><br>

              At Jupyeah, the most popular good is female clothes. “So many girls come (to the event). Everyone takes a

          <div style="text-align: start;">
            <p>But it was not the case ten years ago. Many people did not accept the idea.
              They could not understand why they needed to pay in order to join the swapping event and to get secondhand
              clothes. “Why wear secondhand clothes?” Samathy recalled some people would ask.</p><br>
            <p>
              “At the beginning, it was more because of the greediness,” Samathy recalled. “There was a time when we had
              a
              Jupyeah event in the old days, some aunties brought a suitcase with them.” “Regardless of what was what,
              they
              took everything.” She said. Now attendants are not allowed to bring suitcases to the event. Jupyeah
              provides
              large IKEA bags for attendants to carry their stuff. Each person can take up to one IKEA bag of things at
              the event.
            </p><br>
            <p>“It was after four to five years since we started doing this thing that people began to change their
              mind.” She said. “There are more people who accept secondhand clothes across Hong Kong nowadays, I think.”
            </p><br>
            <p>
              When asked what brings the changes, she referred to the general environment in the world. “The trend of
              sustainability, climate change, pollution. These topics about environmental protection,” said Samathy,
              “Those promotions help.” She also mentioned that social media plays a role in increasing people’s
              awareness of sustainability, sharing, and secondhand consumption.

          <h2 class="mt-0  mb-3 font-weight-normal" style="text-align: left;">COVID-19 brings unprecedented challenges.
          </h2>
          <div style="text-align: start;margin-top:4em;">
            <p>
              <span456>T</span456>he COVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges to Yen’s business. Since the pandemic
              began, there have been fewer
              visitors coming to the physical shop. People have been working at home and reducing the
              frequency of going out. “There has been little demand for clothes.” She said, “The pandemic is the most
              serious impact we have encountered since we started the business.”
            </p><br>

            <p>For the supply side, Yen also met some problems. “The quality of the clothes (received from customers)
              declined,” she said. </p><br>

            A break 93 adopts pre-loved apparel from customers and resells the items in the store. It only accepts
            female clothes or bags at least 80 percent new. “Most of the consignors are from the middle class,” said
            Yen, “Before the pandemic, they would travel to Japan, to Europe, and buy clothes. If they found the
            clothes did not fit, they would bring it here and sell it.” However, travel has been restricted since the
            pandemic began. She found that that group of consignors had disappeared. “Because they didn’t buy new
            clothes, we didn’t (receive many) new clothes during that time.” </p><br>
            <p>

              She also notices that as people purchase fewer clothes, instead of selling their old clothes, they would
              wear the old clothes repeatedly, leaving them few clothes to send to a break 93 for sale. </p><br>
            <p>

              Redress also found that people re-wear the same clothes more often than pre-COVID times. According to the
              survey, two out of three Hong Kongers have changed their clothes consumption habits due to COVID-19, and
              more than half of the respondents said they had enough clothes. </p><br>
            <p>

              Ms. Fok admits that she now buys fewer clothes than in the pre-pandemic period. “After the pandemic, I do
              go out of the street much less (than before).” She said. For example, she would go out for up to
              twenty-five days per month before COVID-19 but only five days during the pandemic, including going
              downstairs to fetch the take-out. </p><br>


            But Ellie finds herself buying more clothes than before. Before the pandemic, she used to buy clothes one
            to two times a month. She mentioned that because now she travels less and spends more time in Hong Kong,
            she can buy more clothes than before. “Around two to three times a month,” said Ellie. </p><br>
            <p>

              Due to the social movement and pandemic, Jupyeah has not holden any events for nearly two years. During
              that time, they had no income. Samathy said that they still needed to pay the fixed cost. “For example, we
              have storage. We need to pay the warehouse.” </p><br>
            <p>

              Green Ladies & Green Little also faced a downturn in its secondhand clothes business during the past year.
              According to Petty, the enterprise witnessed around a 25% drop in its sales at the beginning of the
              pandemic. </p><br>

          <div style="text-align: start;margin-top:4em;">

            <p>The other challenge is people management.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>“People are terrified of the virus. Our staff also. They just worried, and they don't want to take risks
              to work and to like serving some strangers,” Petty recalled, “And also at the beginning, some of the
              customers were not quite used to wearing the mask. They even came to our shop without wearing their masks.
              So it was very difficult for us to comfort our stuff and to be more professional.” During the Chinese
              New Year in 2020, when the COVID-19 broke out in Hong Kong, Green Ladies closed its stores for two weeks
              to let the staff rest at home and minimize the risk of spreading the virus.</p>

            </p><br>
            <p> The situation is much better now as people are getting used to the pandemic. “Our staff also feel more
              confident because they know more about the virus thing and how to prevent it,” Petty said. </p>
            <br>
            <p> But things are different for Yen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              “Recruitment was easier during the pandemic,” Yen said. She was looking for part-time shop assistants.
              “Due to the economic recession during the pandemic, many people could not land a full-time job, especially
              fresh graduates. They choose to do a part-time job first.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>But it is no longer the case now. As the economy in Hong Kong is recovering from the pandemic, it becomes
              less challenging for people to find a full-time job. “After July in 2021, people receive full-time offers
              gradually,” said Yen. It is hard for a break 93 to maintain its staff during the post-pandemic era.
              “Everyone wants a full-time job.” She said. “The pay here is not very high. Most of our employees were
              here for transitions (to a full-time job).”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> A break 93 opened a pop-up shop at Prince Edward during the pandemic because of cheap rent. But Yen had
              to close the shop after eight months. “Because we couldn’t find people to hire.” She said.
            </p>
            <br>

          </div>
          <h2 class="mt-0  mb-3 font-weight-normal" style="text-align: left;">Hygiene Concern?
          </h2>
          <div style="text-align: start;margin-top:4em;">

            <p>Clothes and towels can carry germs and viruses. The secondhand clothing stores interviewed have given
              special care to the hygiene of their clothes during the pandemic but not much. This is partly because
              usually, the clothes need to wait for several days before showing up in the store. <a
                href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33910996/">Research</a> suggests that
              coronavirus can remain on the fabric surface for up to 72 hours.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>“When we collect those clothing, we need some more time to handle it for the data entry and inventory
              issue. We will keep the clothes say more than ten days before showing them at our shop,” Petty explained.
              Green Ladies also purchases a particular sanitizer specializing in tackling the coronavirus. The staff
              would use the spray to sanitize the clothes after customers try them on.

            <p>Consignors must clean the clothes before giving them to the secondhand shops. Both Green Ladies and a
              break 93 do not wash the clothes they received but would steam the clothes before displaying them in the
              store.

            <p>“First of all, we will suggest our consignor clean their clothes before giving them to us,” said Petty.
              “I think it is an educational process because we would like to educate them to donate or consign more
              consciously before giving us what we can call their waste or something extra.”</p><br>
            <p>Yen also mentioned that secondhand clothes are actually “cleaner” than the new ones because there are
              many chemical leftovers from the manufacturing process on the new clothes, which may cause harm to our
              skin. For example, disperse dye, a synthetic dye used in clothes production, may cause allergic contact
              dermatitis. <a href="https://time.com/5631818/wash-new-clothes/">Expert</a> suggests that this chemical is
              present in a high volume on new clothes. It is also
              mentioned that washing helps remove this chemical from the clothes.
            </p><br>
            <p>“But for the secondhand, the person (previous owner) has washed and worn many times. Those chemicals are
              washed away. Your skin will not be so sensitive (to the chemicals).” She said.

            Fashion also matters.
          </h2>

          <div style="text-align: start;margin-top:4em;">
            <p>Most NGOs or secondhand shops in Hong Kong would emphasize the importance of sustainability in their
              brands. But from Yen’s point of view, it might not be the case.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> “I would not abandon my good life for sustainability,” said she. Before starting a break 93, Yen had
              decided to make fashion the top priority of the business. “People look for beautiful things.” </p>
            <br>
            <blockquote class="quote2">“If you want to make this model a sustainable business model, you must take
              different
              needs from different people in the market into consideration.” <br><span

            <p>Staff at a break 93 offer to help customers choose clothes and find their styles at the store.
              “Many customers come here because they know the clothes here are pretty.

              Also, they know how to get a
              style,” said Yen.

            </p>

            <br>
            <p> She admits that there is a group of people who shops for sustainability. “They themselves are very
              eco-friendly.” “But there is also a group of people in the market who do not buy (the concept) at all.
              That is the group of people who love fashion so much.”
              Yen said. She mentioned that it is hard to persuade the fashion lovers to buy secondhand for
              sustainability as they wonder why they would
              buy secondhand clothes if it look bad?
            </p>



            <p>Some people criticize a break 93 for being not environmental-friendly enough. “Sometimes people may
              wonder why many of their clothes are not accepted (by a break 93) even there is only a little flaw. You
              say you are eco-friendly but you don’t take my clothes.” Yen recalled. “We would explain that the sense of
              fashion, cleanness, and completeness is so important to us.”</p>

          <div style="text-align: start;margin-top:4em;">
            <p>Apart from fashion lovers, Yen also mentioned that people come to a break 93 to find new clothes when
              they change their jobs. “They may not know what to wear. Then they come to choose (clothes).”
              Pregnant women also come to find their clothes. “Their belly would get bigger and bigger and then return
              to small. Buying new clothes would be wasteful. So they would choose secondhand clothes, which are cheaper
              and save them from creating new trash.” said Yen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>She has seen customers aged between 25 and 60 years old coming to the shop. “Most of them are from 30 to
              45 years old.” She said. “Some students would come. Some customers would take their mom here.”.</p><br>

            <p>Many of the Jupyeah’s events participants are in their 20s and 30s. Samathy said it is a good sign that
              many young people accept using secondhand goods nowadays. “If they accept it, their next-generation would
              also accept it.”</p>
            <br>
            <p>While more and more people are trying secondhand clothes in Hong Kong, others may not give too much
              thought about it.

              Ellie said she had come across vintage clothes on the internet and did not hate secondhand clothes, but
              she did not know where to buy them. “I don’t have any people around me have the hobby (of buying
              secondhand clothes),” said she.


              Ms. Fok has never purchased pre-owned clothes. “I think I am a little bit of mysophobia. I prefer to wear
              brand new clothes,” She said.

              people to buy and sell pre-loved designer
              children’s & maternity fashion. In the documentary <a
                href="https://joannabowers.com/portfolio/refashioned/">reFashioned</a>, she also talked about parents’
              concerns
              about buying secondhand clothes. “The Chinese are particularly skeptical about secondhand children’s
              clothing because they don’t want to pass on bad luck from the previous owner.”
            </p><br>
            <p>“Actually, many people told us that they want to consign and sell men’s clothes or children’s clothes,”
              said Yen, “But I think it is just a tiny part of the whole.” She mentioned that it is not because many
              mothers do not like secondhand clothing, but they just really love their babies and would rather buy new
              clothes. “Some people may say they would exchange clothes with their friends.” she said. But buying
              secondhand clothes from a shop is different from exchanging clothes with someone you know. “Because you
              know where the clothes come from if your friend gives it to you.” She explained.

            <p>When asked to rate the level of awareness of sustainable fashion consumption in Hong Kong, Petty thinks
              Hong Kong is at 60% of Japan. She mentioned that she found secondhand clothes were quite popular when she
              visited Japan. “It is like a treasure,” said Petty. “You can see the secondhand clothing, secondhand shops
              everywhere.”</p><br>

            <p>“Maybe not many outlets or many shops are doing the same thing in Hong Kong. So I would say like 60 % of
              Japan.” She said.</p>
